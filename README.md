Dormium is a mattress manufacturer from Tuzla, i wanted to create a e-commerce website for them, where they could easily update their catalog.
A huge help in this endevour was a freecodecamp tutorial where they walked me through most of the project. 

*some concepts that where explored : Destructuring, event handlers, loops, if/else statements, API manipulation, CMS.

in the future updates:
 /payment method/side menu/ fresh re-design

More is to come
